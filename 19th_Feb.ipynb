    "Flask is a lightweight web application framework written in Python. It is designed to be simple, flexible, and easy to use. Flask provides the basic tools and features needed to build web applications, without imposing any particular way of doing things. It is widely used for developing small to medium-sized web applications, APIs, and microservices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask framework include:\n",
    "1. Lightweight and Flexible: Flask is a lightweight framework that allows developers to choose and integrate different libraries and tools according to their needs.\n",
    "2. Easy to Learn: Flask has a simple and easy-to-learn API, making it ideal for beginners who want to learn web development using Python.\n",
    "3. Extensible: Flask is highly extensible and supports a wide range of extensions and libraries, making it easy to add new features and functionality to your web application.\n",
    "4. Modular Design: Flask is designed to be modular, which means that developers can use only the components they need for their application, making it efficient and fast.\n",
    "5. Well Documented: Flask has excellent documentation and a large community of users who provide support, making it easy to find answers to your questions and get help when needed.\n",
    "6. Testing: Flask provides built-in testing support, making it easy to write tests and ensure that your application is working correctly.\n",
    "7. Scalable: Flask can be easily scaled up to handle large and complex web applications by integrating with other tools and libraries.\n",
    "8. Compatibility: Flask is compatible with many other Python libraries and tools, allowing developers to use the tools they are already familiar with."

    "In Flask, app routing refers to the process of mapping URLs to Python functions or view functions that handle requests and return responses. It is a way of defining how users can access different pages or resources on a web application.\n",
    "To define an app route in Flask, you use the @app.route() decorator, followed by the URL pattern that you want to match. For example, the following code defines a route for the homepage:\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",

    "def home():\n",
    "    \n",
    "   return 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use app routes in Flask to define the structure and behavior of a web application. By defining routes, we can map URLs to specific views or functions, which can handle user requests and return responses accordingly. App routes also help to organize the code and make it more maintainable and easier to understand."
