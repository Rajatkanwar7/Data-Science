    "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that assesses the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. It represents the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model. In other words, it tells you how well the regression line fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values of the dependent variable and the actual values, and dividing it by the total sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the mean value of the dependent variable. The resulting value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit and 0 indicating no fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, R-squared is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared = 1 - (SSR/SST)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where SSR is the sum of squared residuals (the difference between the predicted values and the actual values), and SST is the total sum of squares (the difference between the actual values and the mean value of the dependent variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared values range from 0 to 1, and a higher value indicates a better fit between the regression line and the data. However, it is important to note that a high R-squared value does not necessarily imply a good model. Other factors, such as the significance of the independent variables and the error terms, must also be considered when evaluating the performance of a regression model."

    "Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of the R-squared value that takes into account the number of independent variables in a linear regression model. Unlike R-squared, adjusted R-squared penalizes the addition of irrelevant or redundant independent variables to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared = 1 - [(1 - R-squared) * (n - 1) / (n - p - 1)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where n is the sample size, and p is the number of independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between adjusted R-squared and R-squared is that adjusted R-squared is a better measure of model fit when there are multiple independent variables. R-squared will always increase with the addition of more independent variables, even if they are not actually improving the model. Adjusted R-squared, on the other hand, will only increase if the new independent variable improves the model beyond what would be expected by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a higher adjusted R-squared value indicates a better model fit, and it is preferable to use adjusted R-squared when comparing models with different numbers of independent variables. However, it is important to note that adjusted R-squared is not without its limitations and should be used in conjunction with other measures of model fit when evaluating the performance of a regression model."

    "Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization is a technique used in regression analysis to penalize complex models by adding a regularization term to the objective function.

    "Objective function = RSS + alpha * ∑|βi|\n",

    "Lasso regularization differs from Ridge regularization in that it uses the absolute value of the coefficients, while Ridge regularization uses the squared value of the coefficients as the penalty term.

    "When it comes to selecting between Lasso and Ridge regularization, it depends on the type of data and the goal of the analysis.

    "1. Interpretability: Regularized linear models can make interpretation of the model more difficult.

    "4. Choice of hyperparameters: Regularized linear models require the choice of hyperparameters such as alpha.
