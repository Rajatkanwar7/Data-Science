    "#### Elastic Net regression is a type of linear regression model that combines both L1 and L2 regularization methods to overcome some of the limitations of these techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "In L1 regularization (Lasso regression), the model adds a penalty term to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. This results in a sparse model, where some coefficients are exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. However, Lasso can only select at most n predictors, where n is the number of observations in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In L2 regularization (Ridge regression), the model adds a penalty term to the sum of the squares of the coefficients. This method does not perform feature selection, but it can handle multicollinearity in the predictors.\n",

    "Elastic Net regression combines both L1 and L2 regularization methods by adding a penalty term that is a combination of the L1 and L2 norms of the coefficients. The resulting model is able to perform both feature selection and handle multicollinearity at the same time.\n"

However, this can result in loss of information and reduced statistical power if the missing values are informative or the data set is small.\n",

However, imputation can introduce bias and reduce the variability of the data, so it is important to choose an appropriate imputation method that is suitable for the nature of the missing data.\n",

This approach allows the model to capture any patterns or associations associated with missing data, but may not be appropriate for continuous predictors.\n",
