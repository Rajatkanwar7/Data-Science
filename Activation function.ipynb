    "### Ans:\n",
    "An activation function in the context of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron or node. It determines whether the neuron should be activated or not, which influences the network's ability to learn and make decisions. Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Without non-linear activation functions, a neural network would simply behave like a linear model, regardless of its depth.\n",
