    "Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format or representation to another, typically with the goal of making it suitable for storage or transmission. In the context of data science, data encoding is important for preparing data for machine learning algorithms and other types of data analysis.\n",
    "Data encoding is useful in data science for a number of reasons. \n",
    "1. It allows for data to be transformed into a more suitable format for machine learning algorithms to process.\n",
    "2. It can help to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets.\n",
    "3. Data encoding can also help to improve the accuracy and performance of machine learning models by providing them with more meaningful and informative features."

Here, the categories have a natural order based on the level of education, and using a numerical encoding scheme that preserves this order may be more meaningful than using one-hot encoding.\n",

One situation where one-hot encoding may be preferred over nominal encoding is when the categories in a feature are not ordinal and have no meaningful order or hierarchy. For example, consider a feature that represents eye color, with possible values being \"blue\", \"brown\", \"green\", and \"hazel\".
