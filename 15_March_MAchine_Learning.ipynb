The goal of the algorithm is to learn the mapping between input and output variables. Supervised learning is used in classification and regression tasks.\n",

The goal of the algorithm is to learn from both the labeled and unlabeled data to improve its performance on the task. Semi-supervised learning is used when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.\n",
