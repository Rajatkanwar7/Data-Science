    "A database is a collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of the data. Databases are used to store large amounts of data that can be accessed, updated, and managed by multiple users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between SQL and NoSQL: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Model: SQL databases use a fixed schema, which means that the structure of the data is predefined and all data has to fit into this structure. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use a flexible schema, which means that the data structure can be changed as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query Language: SQL databases use SQL to retrieve and manipulate data. NoSQL databases have their own query languages, which are often less powerful than SQL, but are more flexible and easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means that they can only be scaled up by adding more hardware resources to the server. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, which means that they can be scaled out by adding more servers to the database cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Consistency: SQL databases offer strong data consistency, which means that data is always consistent across all nodes in the database. NoSQL databases often sacrifice data consistency in favor of scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Storage: SQL databases are usually used for structured data that fits neatly into tables. NoSQL databases are often used for unstructured or semi-structured data, such as JSON documents or key-value pairs."

    "Commonly used DDL commands in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: It is used to create a new table or other database objects such as views, procedures, and indexes. For example, to create a table named \"Employees\" with columns such as ID, Name, and Salary, the following SQL statement can be used:\n",

    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row of the table. It is used to enforce the integrity of the data and ensure that each row in the table is uniquely identified. A primary key cannot contain null values, and its value must be unique for each row. Typically, a primary key is created when a table is first created, and it is used as a reference point for other tables.\n",

    "For example, in a table named \"Employees\", the primary key may be the \"ID\" column, which contains unique values for each employee. This ensures that each row in the \"Employees\" table is uniquely identified by its ID, and that no two employees have the same ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish relationships between tables and enforce referential integrity. A foreign key can have null values, which indicates that there is no corresponding record in the referenced table.\n",

    "For example, in a table named \"Orders\", a foreign key may be the \"EmployeeID\" column, which refers to the \"ID\" column in the \"Employees\" table. This establishes a relationship between the \"Orders\" table and the \"Employees\" table, and ensures that each order is associated with a specific employee."
