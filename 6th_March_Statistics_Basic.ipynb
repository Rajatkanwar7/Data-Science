They include measures of central tendency (such as mean, median, and mode) and measures of dispersion (such as variance, standard deviation, and range). Descriptive statistics are useful for understanding the overall characteristics of a dataset, such as its shape, spread, and distribution.\n",

Inferential statistics are useful for testing hypotheses, making predictions, and drawing conclusions based on limited data.\n",

Different levels of measurement require different statistical techniques, and the choice of statistical tests can affect the accuracy and validity of the results.\n",

    "For example, if we have data on the colors of flowers (e.g., red, yellow, blue) and we want to analyze the data, we need to determine the level of measurement of the data. If the data is nominal, we can only use descriptive statistics like frequency counts, mode, and percentages. We cannot use statistical methods like t-tests or ANOVA, which require interval or ratio data.\n",

    "On the other hand, if we have data on the weights of flowers (e.g., 2 grams, 5 grams, 10 grams), we can use interval or ratio data analysis techniques to compare means, variances, and other statistical parameters. If we mistakenly treat this data as nominal or ordinal data, we may make incorrect inferences about the data and draw inaccurate conclusions.\n",
