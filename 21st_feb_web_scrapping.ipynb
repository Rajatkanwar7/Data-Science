    "Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites and web pages using software tools or scripts. The goal of web scraping is to collect useful information from the web, such as product prices, customer reviews, news articles, weather data, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used for various reasons, including:\n",
    "1. Data analysis: Web scraping allows businesses and individuals to collect large amounts of data from websites, which can then be analyzed and used for research, market analysis, and other purposes.\n",
    "2. Automation: Web scraping can be used to automate repetitive tasks, such as data entry or monitoring changes on a website.\n",
    "3. Competitive analysis: Web scraping can be used to monitor competitor activity, such as pricing or product changes, and help businesses stay ahead of the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three specific areas where web scraping is commonly used:\n",
    "1. E-commerce: Web scraping is frequently used in e-commerce to collect product information, such as prices, availability, and customer reviews, from competitor websites. This data can then be used to adjust pricing strategies or improve product offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Marketing: Web scraping can be used to collect data on customers, such as social media profiles or email addresses, which can then be used for targeted marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Research: Web scraping is also used in academic research to collect data for studies and analyses, such as sentiment analysis of news articles or social media posts."

    "Some common Methods used for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parsing HTML: This involves analyzing the structure of the HTML code of a webpage and extracting the desired information. This can be done using Python libraries like Beautiful Soup, lxml, and html5lib.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using APIs: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access data in a structured format. This can be a faster and more efficient way to obtain data, but it requires access to the website's API and an understanding of the API's documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Automated scraping tools: There are several software tools available for web scraping that can automate the process of extracting data from websites. Examples include Scrapy,Selenium, and Puppeteer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Manual copying and pasting: In some cases, it may be necessary to manually copy and paste data from a website into a spreadsheet or other tool. This method is time-consuming and not recommended for large amounts of data, but it can be useful for small-scale scraping or when other methods are not feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data extraction services: There are also companies that offer web scraping as a service, where they use their own tools and techniques to extract data from websites on behalf of clients."

Each stage is composed of one or more actions, such as fetching code from a repository, building the code, running tests, and deploying the code.\n",

Developers can use CodePipeline to create a pipeline that automatically deploys new code changes to an Elastic Beanstalk environment, running tests and checks before the new code is deployed to ensure it works correctly. Once the code is successfully deployed to an Elastic Beanstalk environment, Elastic Beanstalk will automatically handle the scaling and management of the environment to ensure the application can handle increased traffic and load."
