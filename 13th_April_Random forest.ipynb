    "#### Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by using two main techniques: bootstrapping and feature bagging.\n",
    "1. Bootstrapping: At each tree-building step, Random Forest Regressor randomly samples a subset of the training data with replacement. This process is known as bootstrapping. By creating multiple decision trees on different subsets of the training data, the model can better capture the general patterns in the data and reduce the variance of the model.\n",
    "2. Feature bagging: In addition to bootstrapping, Random Forest Regressor also randomly selects a subset of features to consider at each split of a tree. This process is known as feature bagging. By considering only a subset of the features, the model is less likely to overfit to specific features and can capture the more important features that are relevant for making accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these techniques, Random Forest Regressor can create a set of diverse decision trees that are less correlated with each other, leading to a reduction in the overall variance of the model. The final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor is obtained by aggregating the predictions of all the individual trees, which helps to reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the accuracy of the model."

The final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor is then calculated by averaging the predictions of all the individual decision trees in the forest. This aggregation process helps to reduce the variance of the model and improve its overall accuracy.\n",

    "2. max_depth: The maximum depth of each decision tree in the forest. Increasing this parameter can increase the complexity of the individual trees and potentially improve the performance of the model, but can also lead to overfitting.\n",
