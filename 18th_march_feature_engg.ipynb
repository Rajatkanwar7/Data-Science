    "### Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filter Method**:\n",
    "- **Definition**: The Filter method is a feature selection technique that selects features based on their statistical properties and relevance to the target variable, independent of any machine learning model.\n",
    "- **How It Works**: It uses statistical tests and measures, such as correlation coefficients, chi-square tests, and mutual information, to evaluate the importance of each feature. Features are ranked or scored, and a subset is selected based on these scores. This method is computationally efficient as it evaluates features individually without involving model training."

    "### Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrapper Method**:\n",
    "- **Definition**: The Wrapper method evaluates feature subsets based on their performance with a specific machine learning model.\n",
    "- **Difference from Filter Method**:\n",
    "  - **Evaluation**: Wrapper methods involve training the model multiple times with different subsets of features and selecting the subset that results in the best model performance (e.g., highest accuracy, lowest error).\n",
    "  - **Computational Cost**: Wrapper methods are computationally expensive as they require multiple model evaluations.\n",
    "  - **Consideration**: Wrapper methods consider interactions between features, while Filter methods do not."
