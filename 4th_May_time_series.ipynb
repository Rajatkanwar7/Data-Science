    "#### Ans:\n",
    "- **Recommendation**: ARIMA or its variants (such as SARIMA) would be suitable if the data shows trend and/or seasonality. For seasonal data, SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) accounts for seasonal patterns. Additionally, if the data is large or complex, more advanced models like Prophet or machine learning models could be considered."

    "  - **Dependence on historical data**: Forecasts are based on past patterns and may not account for sudden changes or new trends.\n",
